# Simple-Calculator-in-python-using-tkinter
This is a very basic level project which creates a simple calculator for simple calculations.
We have uploaded 1 screenshot of the output of our calculator.

Code is very simple but you should have some knowledge about tkinter library.
All basics of tkinter is used. If you wanted to learn basics of tkinter then visit - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm#:~:text=Tkinter%20is%20the%20standard%20GUI,to%20the%20Tk%20GUI%20toolkit.&text=Import%20the%20Tkinter%20module.

In our code we have created functions of each button and when the button is pressed then that functions will come in action.

Thank you
